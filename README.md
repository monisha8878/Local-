Beginner HTML Project

This is one of my very first web development projects — built with just **HTML**, a touch of **CSS**, and curiosity.  
It’s a simple static site that helped me understand the basics of web structure, page layout, and styling.

## 🛠️ What I Learned

- Basic HTML structure (`<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`, etc.)
- Using tags like `<div>`, `<p>`, `<a>`, `<img>`, and lists

- Structuring a clean and readable layout
- Linking multiple HTML pages

🔖 Notes
This was a practice project — not production-level — but it laid the foundation for everything that came after. I'm keeping it here to track progress and share how I started with web development.



📌 Built with 💻 and lots of learning.
